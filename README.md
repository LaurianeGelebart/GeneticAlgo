# 🧬 Create Creature with Genetic Algorithm

**By Lauriane Gélébart**  
Project for AI Class, IMAC3 (E5 ESIEE Paris) - October 2024

Developed in **Unity** 🎮

### 🐙 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of a genetic algorithm to create unique creatures—part octopus, part jellyfish, floating in the air. Each creature's characteristics evolve across generations. Five main attributes are influenced by each creature's genome:
- Creature's size 
- Creature's color
- Tentacle count
- Tentacle length
- Tentacle curvature

Creatures are displayed by generation, from the first to the last, allowing you to observe the evolutionary progression of the population.

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LaurianeGelebart/GeneticAlgo.git
   ```

2. **Open the project** in Unity (version 2022.3.4f1 or later recommended).

3. **Run the project** to start the simulation.



### 🔧 Customizing the Simulation

💡 Adjust parameters in the `GeneticAlgoController` script to see variations in the creatures' evolution! Modify values to influence population diversity and behavior.
